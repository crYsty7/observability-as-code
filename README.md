## Welcome to Instana Observability as Code Repository

This repository includes a list of Instana integration packages that are officially maintained by IBM Instana team and the tooling to support the lifecycle management of Instana integration package.

### Instana Integration Package

The Instana integration package is a package composed by different custom elements, including custom dashboards, etc., that support the integration of a specific technology.

It is a way of extending Instana to support the observability of technologies that have not been supported yet by Instana. By importing an integration package for a certain technology into an Instana environment, the Instana system will gain the ability to observe this specific technology immediately.

The package can also be published to a central registry where it can be explored, downloaded, and consumed by other users.

### Instana CLI for Integration Package Management

The Instana CLI for Integration Package Management a tool that can be used to manage the lifecycle of Instana integration package.

For example, you can use this CLI to download the integration package from a central registry to your local machine, then install the package into an existing Instana environment.

You can also use the CLI to initialize an empty package for you, then add custom elements into it. After you finish crafting the package, you can use the same CLI to publish it to the centry registry for other people to consume.
